2p valence protocol (2 consecutive days)
ARDUINO SKETCH: valence_2p

Odors: made fresh daily
800ul Mineral oil + 
300ul coyote urine or
300ul female urine (pool urine from several (3+) females, approx 3-6 months old
		Day 1 = 150ul urine collected previous day (kept in -20C) + 150ul freshly collected urine
		Day 2 = use same odor vials
15 pseudorandom alternating presentations of each

Following odor presentations, there is a 2 min pause to remove nose cone and position lick spout

Sucrose delivery: 10% sucrose, 0.3%NaCl
	~2ul/delivery
	30 presentations
If reward is not collected in a timely manner, imaging cycle will cease and next trial will begin.

Shocks
	~0.3mA. However, actually amount delivered will depend on contact between electrode and tail
	10 presentations

Sound/air blasts
	~75 dB white noise in conjunction with ~8 PSI airpuff to R eye/snout
10 presentations


This current iteration of the experiment differs from previous iteration (2018) in the following ways:
Did not use “old” female urine previously
40 sucrose deliveries were given
Shock amplitude ostensibly = 0.5mA (but I suspect shock cuff was delivering less, hence the lower amplitude for this iteration, which has a better shock cuff that I believe delivers more current)
No blasts were given (this is why they were tacked on at end of current iteration, so as to make the session exactly the same as previous version up until blasts section)
Odor and sucrose/shock were captured during different imaging sessions
Pre- and post-US imaging durations differed
	

If I were to do experiment over:
Reduce odor presentations to 10 each (although should confirm that this is indeed ok, after analyzing data)
Make odor concoction using only 200ul of mineral oil (think mineral oil suppresses urine, which sinks)
Increase shock amplitude slightly  to .35mA
Increase sucrose delivery to ~5ul each and decrease deliveries to only 20 (again, confirm after analysis)
Probably would intersperse all stimuli, as I now know animals will still  lick after being shocked
